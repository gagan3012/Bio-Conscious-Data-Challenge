# Bio Conscious Data Challenge
I have used machine learning to predict the blood sugar levels and then testing my models accuracy with RMSE, MARD, and A + B region accuracy on the Parkes Error Grid, which is an iteration of the Clarke Error Grid.   

The results are attached as png fles in the repo 

The notebooks folder contains the folder for analysis and visulaistion of data as well the model testing notebooks.
The data folder contains the data provide to me 
The src folder contains the code for my machine learning model with the latest version 

To test out the model fork this repo and then 
cd src 
python newpred.py
